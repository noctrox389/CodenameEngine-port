  <summary><h2>What can you do or not do</h2></summary>

  ### You can:
  - Download and play the engine with its mods and modpacks
  - Mod and fork the engine (without using it for illicit purposes)
  - Contribute to the engine (for example through *Pull Requests*, *Issues*, etc)
  - Create a sub engine with Codename Engine as **TEMPLATE** with **CREDITS** (for example leaving the *credits menu submenu with the GitHub contributors* and putting the *[main devs](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs)* in a *README* specifying that it's a *sub engine from Codename Engine*)
  - Release excutable mods that use Codename Engine as source (Specifing that uses Codename Engine by for example the same way written above this)
  - Release modpacks

  ### You can't:
  - Create a *side/new/etc* engine (or mod that doesn't use Codename Engine) using Codename Engine's code
  - Steal code from Codename Engine for another different project that is not Codename Engine related (Codename Engine mods excluded) without properly crediting
  - Release the entire Codename Engine on platforms (Mods that use Codename Engine as source are fine, if it's specified even better)
